Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When we initialize a repository using "git init", a file called .git is created in our directory, and the reason this is needed is to track the history of commits we will eventually create for a repository.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is where we prepare added files that we will eventually commit to the repository. This gives us a space to check which files we're going to add before committing right away.
